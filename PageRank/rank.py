"""
    This is an iterative algorithm used for ranking html pages. Initially, all pages are ranked 1/n, where n is the total number
    of pages. In each iteration, rank of page A is given by the following formula:
        rank(A) = log(wcA + 1, 100)*((1 - d) + d * Î£(rank(Bi) / L(Bi)*(1 + log(wcBi + 1, 100)))
        wcA - total number of searched keywords on page A
        wcBi - total number of searched keywords on page Bi
        d - damping factor (suggested value is 0.85)
        Bi - pages which link to page A
        L(Bi) - total number of pages Bi links to
    Pages are ranked and kept in a dictionary, in pairs of <page_path>:<rank>

    Arguments required are:
        max_iter - maximum number of iterations for the algorithm
        pages - a list of all pages in the graph
        graph - a graph which represents pages and links between them
        htmlLoader - HtmlLoader object (used for calling certain methods)
        words - a list of keywords which need to be contained
