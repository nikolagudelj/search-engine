"""
    PageRank algorithm is an iterative algorithm. Initially, all pages are ranked 1/n, where n is the total number
    of pages. In each iteration, rank of page A is given by the following formula:
        rank(A) = (1 - d) + d * Î£(rank(Bi) / L(Bi)
        d - damping factor (suggested value is 0.85)
        Bi - pages which link to page A
        L(Bi) - total number of pages Bi links to
    Pages are ranked and kept in a dictionary, in pairs of <page_path>:<rank>

    Arguments required are:
        max_iter - maximum number of iterations for the algorithm
        pages - a list of all pages in the graph
        graph - a graph which represents pages and links between them
